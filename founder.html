                        <p>Aidan da Costa is honored to be the founder of Melodies for Humanity. Music has been a significant part of his life for many years. As a drum major at Lone Star High School, Aidan has helped lead the band to historic achievements, including placing 6th in the UIL State Finals. He has been playing the flute for 7 years and is a proud member of the Lone Star Wind Symphony, which performed as the 2024 TMEA honor band. Additionally, he enjoys playing the tenor saxophone in the school's jazz band and performing guitar and vocals in a band.</p>
                        <p>Beyond his involvement in various musical ensembles and as a soloist, Aidan is deeply passionate about using music to make a positive impact on others. He has volunteered in his church's music ministry for over six years as a flutist and singer, reinforcing his belief in music's power to serve and inspire communities. Through Melodies for Humanity, he aims to connect talented high school musicians with opportunities to perform for those who would be blessed by music, such as individuals in senior centers and hospitals. He believes in the transformative power of music and its ability to uplift and inspire, and strives to spread joy and comfort through these performances.</p>
